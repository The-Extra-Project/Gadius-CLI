# @gaedus/Contracts


This package represents the deployment of the various contracts that represent the lifecycle of the geospatial data attestation / dataset curation as NFT's and bidding mechanism. 

These are deployed across the chains defined in [hatdhat-config](./hardhat.config.ts):

## description of the various smart contracts and bounties covered: 
- [Lillypad](): this contract gives the ability to not only schedule the jobs onchain, but also allows the clients to fetch the status of the mediators (providinng the server to run the jobs) by ranking them based on the resource availablity, thus building an adapter for clients to scedule jobs efficiently.
